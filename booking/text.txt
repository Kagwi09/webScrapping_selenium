    # add a new attribute that defines tear down in the init function and assign it as False
    # add an if statement inside the exit function that executes when teardown is True
    # if you want to tear down, pass an argument to the run file inside the Booking method, specifying teardown as True
    # add tear_down=True if you want  to close the browser after loading
