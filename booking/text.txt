1. The constants file stores the variables
2. The __init__ file is a package file
3. The booking file stores the methods that will be called later
    # The booking class inherits from webdriver.Chrome
    # Chrome has to start with a capital letter
 4. super(Booking, self).__init__() initiates an instance of  webdriver.chrome, this enables other methods(functions)
    to access the methods of the webdriver(get, find e.t.c)
 5. Create a function land_first_page that opens the url using the get method
 6. Add a context manager to the run file using the with statement
    # add an exit function to the class
    # the exit function works as a way to test the if the program is working
    # it shuts down(tear down) chrome after launching it
    # add a new attribute that defines tear down in the init function and assign it as False
    # add an if statement inside the exit function that executes when teardown is True
    # if you want to tear down, pass an argument to the run file inside the Booking method, specifying teardown as True
    # add tear_down=True if you want  to close the browser after loading
